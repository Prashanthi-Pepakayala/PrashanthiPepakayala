To begin preparing the interactive video for my class assignment, I first researched and gathered relevant information on the topic.Next, I created a storyboard outlining the structure and flow of the video.
I have used my knowledge in Generative AI and given the prompts to mould my video as per my requirements regarding the time length, captions, background voice-over and the relevancy to the playing footage. 
Using a video editor software, I then made small changes like adding relevant graphics and animations to keep the video engaging and informative  to the output and finally done with the theory part. 
I uploaded this video in my YouTube channel.
Then using a software called “LUMI”, I added interactive questionnaire session in between the video. The total video length is about 9min 29seconds. The interactive questions are of different formats like filling the blanks, multiple choice, single marked answers, True/False etc. And I finally completed the video and posted it in the common drive.
The whole process was time-consuming but rewarding testing. Overall, I was satisfied with the outcome of my interactive video and felt confident in my ability to create engaging and informative videos in the future.
